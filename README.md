# Notes on challenge
Ultimately I was unable to get the VBA code to successfully run to match the answer key provded for the "Greatest Values" summary table, but am still submitting my work to demonstrate my understanding of the logic of what is supposed to be happening, if not the syntax. 
# Sources 
Cohort member Caleb Gould assisted me with the code for the "Greatest Values" summary table as well as the "Opening_Price"-related codes 
Cohort member Fidel Carillo also assisted me with the code to pull the opening price value.
